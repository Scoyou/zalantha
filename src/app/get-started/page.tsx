          Introduction to LARP: So, you want to LARP? First things first: What
          is LARP? Well, I&apos;m here to tell you. Did you ever play pretend
          when you were younger? Did you pretend to be a ninja, knight, or maybe
          even pretend to fight monsters? LARP is like that, but for adults and
          with some rules. It&apos;s almost like playing a roleplaying game, but
          you become the character. Have you ever played D&D and wanted to do
          more than just roll the dice? With LARP, you can do just that. On this
          page, we will do a brief Introduction to our world, as well as the
          races and classes you can choose from for your character.

        The first step to getting started is to create a character using a race
        and class that you like.
      </p>
      <strong>Races</strong>
      <div>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Orks:</strong> These big brutes are the most barbaric of the
          factions. War is what they crave. Orks are always looking for a good
          fight. Players portraying Orks will paint themselves green and will
          usually have tusks. Orks love to wear war paint, so have fun and get
          creative with it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Dwarves:</strong> This faction comprises miners and are the
          greatest builders in the world. Unlike Dwarves in other media, these
          Dwarves have ram horns growing out of their heads. The Dwarves have
          great beards, and of course, the main feature of this world&apos;s
          Dwarves are their ram horns, which they decorate with paint.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Elves:</strong> These Elves are one of the most magical races
          in the world. They have hints of blue on their skin. Elf players will
          have pointy ears and use blue makeup to lightly apply the blue around
          their skin.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Humans:</strong> One of the most common races in the land of
          Zalantha. Humans have a variety of ways they can dress and do not have
          any key physical features like the other factions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Beastfolk:</strong> This faction has evolved from different
          animals. They could be Minotaurs, wolf men, centaurs, etc. The key for
          players to dress as this race is to combine animal features with human
          features.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Faefolk:</strong> The race of the Faefolk comes from a place
          where wild magic essentially lives. The Faefolk have a lot of color to
          their skin and costumes. Some Faefolk have wings, while some may have
          long, silly antennas. Have fun with thisâ€” the crazier, the better.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can find more details on each race on the{" "}

      </p>
      <strong>Classes</strong>
      <div>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Fighter:</strong> This class is the quintessential melee
          archetype. Knights, barbarians, archers, and monks are among the
          fighters from which you can draw inspiration. Fighters are capable of
          using any weapon in the game.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Rogue:</strong> These are your stealthy operatives.
          Inspiration for rogues can come from thieves, ninjas, assassins,
          pirates, and rangers. If a rogue successfully backstabs another
          player, it counts as double the points. Rogues can use short bows,
          crossbows, daggers, and smaller swords.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Mage:</strong> Mages in this world have a strong affinity for
          magic and are users of the arcane. Inspirations for this class include
          wizards who learned magic through books, sorcerers born with magic,
          and warlocks who made pacts with entities for their magic. Mages&apos;
          weapons include staffs, wands, and daggers.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Bard:</strong> The entertainers of the world, bards are
          storytellers, musicians, and writers who create art inspired by the
          world around them. They possess bardic immunity because their role is
          not to fight but to spin tales. A bard may carry a dagger but is not
          typically combative.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>War Priest:</strong> This class serves as the healers and
          supporters on the battlefield. Their focus is on slinging healing and
          support spells. War Priests are proficient in using maces, axes, and
          swords, usually accompanied by a shield.
