        Rules to LARP By: This LARP uses a point-based system. Each player
        starts with 5 HP at Level 1. With each level gained, players receive an
        additional 2 HP, up to a maximum of Level 12 with 24 HP. Players level
        up at least once after each event. Here's how the point system works:
        each limb hit counts as one point, while a chest hit counts as two
        points. Intentional head hits are strictly prohibited; doing so will
        result in disqualification and prevent leveling up from the event. Only
        foam weapons are allowed, and they must be inspected by a Game Master
        upon arrival. Rules of Magica: The magic in this world is categorized
        into two types: Divine and Arcane. Divine Magic is primarily supportive,
        including abilities like healing and shielding. This form of magic is
        typically used by Warpriests. Arcane Magic is offensive, encompassing
        elemental magics like Fireball or Lightning Bolt, commonly wielded by
        Mages. Magic usage involves rolling a large D20 to determine success or
        failure. Spellcasting rules are as follows: At Level 1, players receive
        one spell, which can be used once per game. With each level-up, players
        can either acquire an additional spell or increase their existing
        spell's level. As a spell's level increases, its Difficulty Rating (DR)
        goes up by 2. This version maintains the essence of your rules while
        enhancing readability and organization, making it easier for players to
        understand and follow.
